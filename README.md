Realm one is an open source tile based game written in Rust using the Amethyst game engine. It is the first game that will be integrated into the distributed MMO platform [Worlds](https://github.com/Machine-Hum/Worlds). Following the implementation anyone will be able to fork this repository and add to the universe!
